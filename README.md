# 🛡️ Safe-DL-Framework

A modular and extensible security framework for deep learning systems, focused on **threat modeling**, **attack simulation**, **defensive strategies**, and **secure deployment**.  
Created as part of a master’s thesis at FEUP by Tiago Barbosa.

## 📚 Documentation

- 📄 [Full Framework Overview](docs/framework.md)
- 🧩 [Module 1 – Threat Modeling](docs/module1.md)

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- Structured **threat modeling** based on attacker goals, data sensitivity, and system architecture
- Simulation of major attacks: **data poisoning**, **backdoors**, **adversarial examples**, **model stealing**, and more
- Automatic defense mapping and benchmarking tools
- Deployment-ready configurations with optional **real-time monitoring**
- YAML-based profiles for reproducibility and automation

## 🧱 Modules Overview

1. **Threat Modeling** – Define attacker capabilities and generate a threat profile  
2. **Attack Simulation** – Launch realistic attacks based on selected threat categories  
3. **Vulnerability Assessment** – Quantify and visualize model weaknesses  
4. **Defensive Strategies** – Automatically recommend and apply countermeasures  
5. **Benchmarking** – Evaluate the impact of defenses in clean and adversarial settings  
6. **Deployment Guidelines** – Secure your final model with best practices  
7. *(Optional)* **Real-Time Monitoring** – Detect anomalies at runtime

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/safe-dl-framework.git
cd safe-dl-framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start by creating a threat profile:

```bash
python threat_model_cli.py
```

Then run the main pipeline with your profile:

```bash
python run_framework.py --profile profiles/my_project.yaml
```
