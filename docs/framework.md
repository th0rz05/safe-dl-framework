# Introduction to the Deep Neural Network Security Framework

In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have become the backbone of many modern applications, ranging from autonomous systems and biometrics to medical diagnostics and cybersecurity. However, with their increasing adoption, there has also been a growing concern regarding their vulnerability to adversarial attacks and other forms of malicious exploitation.

These attacks can occur at various stages of the model lifecycle — from training to inference — and may compromise the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the systems in which they are embedded.

This framework provides a systematic and modular approach to securing deep learning models. It serves as a comprehensive and practical guide for researchers and engineers alike. Throughout the document, I propose a clear division into modules, each with actionable tools and recommendations. This allows anyone to develop, evaluate, and deploy models with robustness and security from the ground up.

The framework can be used both for theoretical analysis and for practical integration into real-world machine learning pipelines.

## Module 1 — Threat Modeling

### Goal of the Module

Before applying any defense technique, it is essential to understand the most likely threats in the specific context of your project. This module provides a structured approach to identify risks, attack surfaces, and attacker goals, enabling informed defensive strategies in the following modules.

### Module Structure

#### 1.1. Attack Surfaces in the Deep Learning Lifecycle

| Phase               | Possible Threats                                     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Data acquisition    | Data poisoning, backdoors, sensor manipulation        |
| Training            | Malicious data injection, weight extraction          |
| Final model         | Model stealing, inversion, membership inference      |
| Inference/Deployment | Adversarial examples, evasion, physical attacks      |
| API Services        | Query-based extraction, denial of service attacks    |

>See [Peng et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021] for examples and references to these threats.

#### 1.2. Types of Attackers and System Knowledge

- **White-box attacker**: full access to architecture, parameters, and data.
- **Black-box attacker**: access only to model outputs (e.g., via API).
- **Gray-box**: partial knowledge (e.g., architecture but not weights).
- **Offline vs Online**: attacks during training (e.g., poisoning) or during inference (e.g., adversarial examples).

#### 1.3. Attacker Motivations

- Sabotage model performance
- Replace model with a compromised version
- Steal private information from training data
- Extract model’s intellectual property
- Fool critical systems (e.g., biometrics, autonomous vehicles)

#### 1.4. General Taxonomy of Attacks

| Main Category        | Subcategories                                      |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Poisoning (training) | Label flipping, clean-label, targeted poisoning   |
| Backdoor (training)  | Trigger-based, federated backdoors                |
| Adversarial (inference) | White-box, Black-box, Physical, Universal     |
| Privacy/Stealing     | Model inversion, extraction, membership inference |

### Threat Profile Checklist

- [ ] Will the model be used in production?
- [ ] What type of data will be used? (sensitive, public)
- [ ] Is the model accessible via public API?
- [ ] What would be the consequences of a model failure?
- [ ] Will the model run on local devices or in the cloud?
- [ ] What type of attacker is most likely? (internal? external?)

### Module Output

After completing the threat profile, the user receives a configuration file that can be reused in the following modules.

```yaml
threat_model:
  model_access: black-box
  attack_goal: untargeted
  deployment_scenario: mobile_device
  data_sensitivity: high
  threat_categories:
    - adversarial_examples
    - data_poisoning
    - model_stealing
recommendations:
  - use_adversarial_training
  - validate_data_sources
  - monitor_API_usage

```

### Conclusion of Module 1

This module establishes the foundation for any robust defense strategy. Without a clear understanding of threats, any defense attempt is blind and potentially ineffective. The result here serves as a configurable input for the following modules — from attack simulation to the application of defenses.

## Module 2 — Adversarial Attacks

### Goal of the Module

Despite the success of deep neural networks in various tasks, they remain highly vulnerable to a wide range of attacks that exploit flaws in their statistical behavior, architectures, or training processes. These attacks — whether during training or inference — can severely compromise the reliability, security, and privacy of deep learning systems.

This module aims to:

- Understand the most relevant attack mechanisms based on recent literature.
- Simulate realistic attacks on custom models to assess vulnerabilities.
- Map previously identified risks (from Module 1) to corresponding attack techniques.
- Prepare the application of targeted defenses in subsequent modules.

---

### Submodule 2.1 — Data Poisoning Attacks

#### Objective

Data poisoning involves the intentional insertion of malicious data into the training set to compromise the model’s performance, behavior, or integrity. These attacks are particularly dangerous because they can be subtle, hard to detect, and have long-lasting effects.

#### Attack Mechanism

The attacker manipulates the training process by injecting poisoned data either directly or indirectly (e.g., through sensors, APIs, crowdsourcing). By introducing carefully crafted examples, the model learns incorrect patterns, resulting in:

- General performance degradation
- Malicious behavior on specific inputs
- Creation of backdoors for future exploitation

#### Data Poisoning Taxonomy

##### 2.1.1. Label Flipping Attacks

- The attacker swaps correct labels (e.g., "cat" images labeled as "dog").
- Simple yet effective, especially in weakly validated datasets.
- Aims to confuse the model and reduce overall accuracy.

##### 2.1.2. Clean-label Attacks

- Poisoned examples appear normal but are crafted to target specific classes.
- No label manipulation is required.
- Example: "Poison Frog" — image looks like class A but is classified as B.

##### 2.1.3. Targeted Poisoning

- Aims to misclassify specific inputs.
- Example: making one person’s face pass as another in a biometric system.
- Requires detailed knowledge of the model or pipeline.

##### 2.1.4. Availability Attacks

- Goal is to degrade overall model performance to make it unusable.
- Inserts examples that induce overfitting, class imbalance, or noise.

#### Real-world Examples

- Compromising facial recognition systems via identity replacement.
- Poisoning public datasets to mislead downstream models.
- Attacks on edge-computing sensor pipelines.

#### Submodule Output

The user can:

- Simulate poisoning attacks on custom datasets (scripts provided).
- Measure performance impact (e.g., accuracy drop, targeted misclassification).
- Visualize manipulated vs legitimate data.
- Generate vulnerability reports before training real models.

#### Metrics Used

- Accuracy before/after poisoning
- Per-class error rate
- Attack specificity (global vs targeted)
- Distribution distance (e.g., Wasserstein)

#### Tools

- TrojanZoo
- BadNets Dataset Creator
- AID-P
- Custom code included in the framework

#### Technical Notes

- Clean-label attacks are especially hard to detect with traditional validation.
- Poisoning can be amplified via transfer learning.
- Modern defenses include data sanitization, influence functions, and robust training — each with limitations.

---

### Submodule 2.2 — Backdoor Attacks

#### Objective

Backdoor attacks implant hidden malicious behaviors in the model, activated only when a specific "trigger" is present in the input. The model performs normally under regular conditions but misbehaves when triggered — e.g., classifying a “cat” as a “car”.

#### Attack Mechanism

During training, the attacker injects examples with a specific visual trigger (e.g., sticker, pattern, modified pixel) labeled intentionally with an incorrect class. The model learns to associate the trigger with the wrong label. During inference, the presence of this trigger activates the malicious behavior.

#### Types of Backdoor Attacks

##### 2.2.1. Static Trigger (BadNets)

- Fixed trigger (e.g., white square in image corner).
- Classic example: BadNets.
- Easy to implement and effective even with low injection rates.

##### 2.2.2. Clean-label Backdoor

- No label manipulation; inputs are subtly poisoned.
- Hard to detect as data appears valid.
- Example: feature collision attacks.

##### 2.2.3. Invisible/Adaptive Triggers

- Triggers generated adversarially or imperceptible to humans.
- May operate in activation space instead of input space.
- Hard to detect with traditional defenses.

##### 2.2.4. Distributed Triggers (FL Backdoors)

- In federated learning, multiple clients collaborate to implant a backdoor.
- Trigger is distributed and harder to trace.
- Relevant for IoT and mobile environments.

#### Real-world Examples

- Facial recognition bypassed using special glasses.
- Modified traffic signs fool autonomous vehicles.
- Security systems triggered by specific photos.

#### Submodule Output

The user can:

- Generate datasets with backdoor triggers.
- Train models with/without backdoors.
- Measure trigger impact during inference.
- Visualize triggered vs clean inputs.

#### Metrics

- Attack Success Rate (ASR)
- Clean Accuracy
- Poisoning Rate
- Trigger Visibility (visible, imperceptible, latent)

#### Tools and Libraries

- TrojanZoo
- Neural Cleanse
- Spectral Signature Analysis

#### Technical Notes

- DNNs memorize sparse patterns, making triggers effective.
- Larger models are more susceptible.
- Practices like early stopping or regularization do not prevent backdoors.

#### Ethical Considerations

This submodule is intended only for:

- Evaluating real risks in training pipelines
- Studying defense effectiveness
- Simulating adversarial environments

---

### Submodule 2.3 — Adversarial Examples (Inference)

#### Objective

This submodule covers inference-time attacks known as adversarial examples. The attacker modifies legitimate inputs by adding imperceptible perturbations that cause the model to misclassify with high confidence.

These are the most widely studied attacks in the literature and pose a direct threat to trained and deployed systems.

#### Attack Mechanism

Given an input `x` and model `f`, the attacker computes a perturbation `δ` such that:

```
f(x) ≠ f(x + δ)
```

Even if `x + δ` looks identical to `x`, the model is fooled — often with even higher confidence. Perturbations can be targeted or untargeted, and constrained using norms (L∞, L2, L0).

#### Types of Adversarial Attacks

##### 2.3.1. White-box Attacks

- Full access to model architecture, weights, gradients.
- Examples: FGSM, PGD, Carlini & Wagner, DeepFool
- Very effective and powerful.
- Relevant in open-source or leaked model scenarios.

##### 2.3.2. Black-box Attacks

- Attacker can only interact with the model.
- Subtypes:
  - Transfer-based: uses a substitute model
  - Score-based: uses output probabilities
  - Decision-based: uses final class only
- Examples: NES, ZOO, Boundary Attack

##### 2.3.3. Targeted vs Untargeted

- Targeted: forces misclassification to a specific class.
- Untargeted: any misclassification is sufficient.
- Most attacks can be adapted to either mode.

##### 2.3.4. Physical Attacks

- Real-world perturbations or triggers.
- Examples: stickers on traffic signs, adversarial glasses, modified clothing.
- Robust to angles, lighting, distance.

##### 2.3.5. Universal Adversarial Perturbations

- A single perturbation `δ` that fools many different inputs.
- Highly effective for attacking models in bulk (e.g., edge devices).

#### Real-world Examples

- Stop sign with stickers misread as "yield".
- Adversarial shirts fool facial recognition.
- Slightly modified images cause misclassification (e.g., "tiger" as "bread").

#### Submodule Output

The user can:

- Simulate adversarial attacks on their models.
- Visualize differences between original and adversarial inputs.
- Measure attack effectiveness.
- Use results to guide future defenses.

#### Metrics

- Attack Success Rate (ASR)
- Average perturbation (`‖δ‖`)
- Distance metrics: L2, L∞, L0
- Robust Accuracy
- Confidence drop/increase

#### Tools and Libraries

- Foolbox
- Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART)
- CleverHans

#### Technical Notes

- White-box attacks are essential for stress testing, even if not always realistic.
- Black-box attacks are more practical (e.g., via APIs).
- Real-world robustness remains highly sensitive to how attacks are generated.

#### Technical Add-ons

- Vision Transformers (ViTs) show different vulnerability patterns than CNNs.
- Adversarial training is the most effective known defense but requires significant compute and lowers clean accuracy.

---

### Submodule 2.4 — Model & Data Stealing Attacks

#### Objective

This submodule focuses on attacks targeting the intellectual property and privacy of deep learning models. The attacker tries to extract the model (structure, weights, hyperparameters) or infer private information from the training data — often without direct access.

These attacks are especially relevant in:

- Public APIs (MLaaS)
- Cloud-based systems
- Proprietary applications

#### Attack Mechanisms

- **Model stealing**: Attacker queries the model and trains a functionally equivalent surrogate using the outputs.
- **Data inference**:
  - **Membership inference**: Determine if a specific sample was part of training data.
  - **Model inversion**: Reconstruct inputs based on model outputs.

#### Types of Attacks

##### 2.4.1. Model Extraction (Stealing)

- Attacker sends thousands of queries to train a surrogate model.
- Replicates behavior of the target model.
- Violates IP, bypasses licensing, enables further attacks.

##### 2.4.2. Membership Inference

- Checks if a given sample was in the training set.
- Important for sensitive data (e.g., medical, biometric).
- Based on confidence differences between seen and unseen examples.

##### 2.4.3. Model Inversion

- Reconstructs input features from model outputs.
- Examples: reconstructing faces or data profiles used in training.
- Major privacy concern.

#### Real-world Examples

- Public API used to reconstruct training face images.
- Commercial model behavior cloned using outputs only.
- Organization finds external model trained on private data.

#### Submodule Output

The user can:

- Test if their model is vulnerable to query-based theft.
- Assess if specific samples are detectable as training members.
- Evaluate inversion risks based on model outputs.

#### Metrics

- Surrogate model accuracy (vs original)
- ASR using stolen model
- True positive rate in membership inference
- Reconstructed image quality (PSNR, SSIM)

#### Tools and Libraries

- ML Privacy Meter
- Membership Inference Tools (TensorFlow Privacy)
- Model Extraction Toolkit (custom implementations)

#### Technical Notes

- Exposing logits and probabilities increases vulnerability.
- Overfitted models are more prone to membership inference.
- Techniques like differential privacy and regularization help but affect performance.

#### Technical Add-ons

- API-based models are especially hard to protect.
- Obscuring architecture is not sufficient.
- Model watermarking is an emerging solution for theft detection.

### Conclusion of Module 2

With this module, the offensive diagnosis phase is complete. From here, the user:

- Understands the main types of attacks,
- Simulates the most relevant ones using the threat profile,
- Is ready to apply targeted defenses based on identified weaknesses.

## Module 3 — Vulnerability Assessment

### Goal of the Module

After simulating attacks in Module 2, this module aims to:

- Analyze the concrete impact of those attacks on the user's model.
- Identify critical vulnerability points (e.g., most affected classes, most effective attack types).
- Prioritize defense strategies for Module 4, based on real evidence.
- Generate a technical vulnerability report that can be included in the project documentation.

---

### 3.1. Quantitative Analysis

For each simulated attack, the system calculates specific vulnerability metrics:

- Accuracy drop
- Attack Success Rate (ASR)
- False detection rate (for backdoors)
- Confidence shift in predictions
- Average perturbation norm ‖δ‖ in adversarial examples

Results are compared against a clean model (baseline), and visualizations are generated, including:

- Confusion matrices
- Confidence boxplots
- Perturbation heatmaps

---

### 3.2. Qualitative Analysis

Visual inspection and analysis of the adversarial inputs:

- Are the generated adversarial inputs perceptible?
- Are specific classes disproportionately affected?
- Are there common patterns in the most vulnerable inputs?

For backdoors:

- Is the trigger visible?
- Is it universal or context-dependent?

For model stealing:

- Can the surrogate model replicate the original behavior?
- Is there a risk of misuse or intellectual property violation?

---

### Module Output

The user receives:

- A vulnerability report (in PDF or Markdown format)

  Includes:
  - Visuals
  - Tables
  - Clear explanations

- A structured JSON/YAML configuration with specific recommendations

- Identifying specific weaknesses allows the system to apply targeted defenses in Module 4.

- It acts as a triage system to guide optimal protection strategies.

----------

### Additional (Optional) Insights

- Include influence functions or saliency map analysis to understand why specific inputs are vulnerable.

- Techniques like activation clustering (for backdoors) can also be integrated.

## Module 4 — Defensive Strategies

### Goal of the Module

Based on the results from Module 3, this module applies specific and tailored defense techniques to address the vulnerabilities identified in the user's model.

The focus is to:

- Mitigate concrete vulnerabilities
- Apply effective defenses with minimal clean performance loss
- Document the impact of each defense clearly
- Prepare the model for robustness reevaluation in Module 5

----------

### Local Evaluation (Internal to the Module)

For each defense, the system evaluates:

- Clean accuracy before/after defense

- Robust accuracy (retesting attacks from Module 2)

- Computational overhead (training time, memory usage)

- Deployment compatibility

----------

### Technical Considerations

- Defenses are modular and interchangeable — the framework does not enforce fixed combinations.

- Some techniques, like adversarial training, have important trade-offs (e.g., training time, reduced clean accuracy).

- Users can manually enable or disable techniques for fine-grained control.

## Module 5 — Evaluation & Benchmarking

### Goal of the Module

This module systematically evaluates:

- The real effectiveness of the defenses applied in Module 4

- **Multi-model comparison**: evaluate different architectures with the same defenses

- **Robustness to distribution shift**: optional extension for advanced use cases

## Module 6 — Deployment Guidelines

### Goal of the Module

Ensure that the robust model developed throughout the framework is deployed securely, efficiently, and in line with the robustness requirements defined in earlier modules.

This module provides best practices, recommended configurations, and final validation steps before moving the model into production — whether as an API, on an edge device, or embedded system.

A team is developing an image classification model for a traffic sign recognition system to be embedded in an autonomous vehicle. The model will be trained on public datasets, exposed through an internal API, and deployed on physical edge devices.

---

### Module 1 — Threat Modeling

The user completes the initial threat profiling form and generates the following configuration:

```yaml
threat_model:
  model_access: gray-box
  attack_goal: targeted
  deployment_scenario: physical_world
  data_sensitivity: medium
  threat_categories:
    - data_poisoning
    - backdoor_attacks
    - adversarial_examples
    - model_stealing
```

> The framework identifies public data usage, physical deployment, and indirect exposure as high-risk factors.

### Module 2 — Attack Simulation

The framework applies relevant attacks:

| Attack Type         | Method Used                | Result                        |
|---------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Data Poisoning      | Clean-label + flipping     | 21% accuracy drop             |
| Backdoor Attack     | BadNets (white square)     | ASR: 92%                      |
| Adversarial Example | PGD ε=0.03                 | Robust Accuracy: 34%         |
| Model Stealing      | Knockoff Nets              | Model Similarity: 87%         |

---

### Module 3 — Vulnerability Assessment

The framework automatically generates the following summary:

```yaml
vulnerabilities:
  data_poisoning:
    severity: medium-high
    recommendation: sanitize dataset + mixup training
  adversarial_whitebox:
    severity: critical
    recommendation: pgd adversarial training
  backdoor:
    severity: critical
    recommendation: neuron pruning + trigger detection
  model_stealing:
    severity: medium
    recommendation: limit API output + watermarking
```

### Module 4 — Defensive Strategies

The framework applies:

- **Mixup Training**  
- **Adversarial Training** using PGD (10 epochs)  
- **Neuron Pruning** targeting the top 20% most anomalous neuron activations  
- **Simplified API Output** (e.g., no softmax or probability scores returned)  
- **Passive Watermarking** embedded into the model weights for theft detection

---

### Module 5 — Evaluation & Benchmarking

| Attack Type     | Accuracy Before | Accuracy After | ASR ↓  | Δ Clean Acc |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| PGD (ε=0.03)    | 34%              | 72%            | -38%   | -2.8%       |
| Backdoor        | 92%              | 5%             | -87%   | -0.9%       |
| Data Poisoning  | 79%              | 88%            | —      | +9%         |

> The applied defenses significantly reduced attack success rates while maintaining strong performance on clean data.

### Module 6 — Deployment Guidelines

- Final deployment checklist completed  
- Model exported using **TorchScript**, with logits removed from outputs  
- **API query rate limit** enforced: 100 requests/minute per IP  
- **Monitoring and logging** enabled, with anomaly alert threshold set  
- Defensive configurations stored and documented for audit and reproducibility  

---

### Final Outcome

With the full framework applied, the team successfully:

- Identified critical risks and threat types  
- Executed realistic attack simulations  
- Assessed and prioritized model vulnerabilities  
- Applied robust and targeted defenses  
- Quantified effectiveness through benchmarking  
- Deployed a production-ready model with built-in protections and monitoring  

## Module 7 — Real-Time Monitoring & Detection (Optional)

### Objective

While the previous modules focus on simulation, mitigation, and defense **prior** to deployment, this module introduces techniques for **real-time monitoring and detection** of adversarial or anomalous behavior **during inference**.

This is particularly important for high-risk applications such as:

- Autonomous vehicles  
- Biometric authentication systems  
- Financial fraud detection  
- Medical diagnostics  

The goal is to complement the existing defenses with a runtime layer that can detect:

- Adversarial inputs in the wild  
- Activation of hidden backdoors  
- Abuse through query flooding or model probing  

---

### Detection Strategies

#### 7.1. Input Validation & Distribution Monitoring

Detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs using:

- **Softmax entropy thresholds**
- **Mahalanobis distance-based detectors**
- **Deep k-NN comparison** with training data

#### 7.2. Adversarial Example Detectors

Lightweight and real-time-compatible techniques:

- **STRIP**: Measures entropy changes under repeated perturbations  
- **MagNet**: Uses autoencoders to reconstruct inputs and measure reconstruction error  
- **Feature Squeezing**: Compares predictions on reduced-precision inputs  

#### 7.3. Trigger Detection for Backdoors

- Monitor neuron activations for abnormal patterns (e.g., sudden spikes)  
- Apply activation clustering or spectral signature analysis  
- Track history of predicted classes and detect statistically rare patterns  

#### 7.4. API-Level Monitoring

- Log and analyze incoming queries:
  - Query frequency per IP/client  
  - Class distribution over time  
  - Similarity of repeated inputs (used in model stealing)

- Flag anomalies such as:
  - Excessively optimized or repeated inputs  
  - High-confidence predictions on low-entropy inputs  

---

### Module Output

- **Real-time alerts/logs** for suspected attacks  
- Optional **input rejection** or fallback to conservative predictions  
- **Weekly reports** summarizing detection statistics  
- Hooks and integration options (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana/ELK)  

---

### Deployment Configuration Example

```yaml
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  detectors:
    - type: strip
      window_size: 10
      entropy_threshold: 0.4
    - type: api_rate_limit
      max_queries_per_minute: 100
    - type: confidence_monitor
      threshold: 0.95
      alert_on_low_entropy: true
  action_on_detection: log_only  
  # options: log_only, reject_input, fallback_prediction
```

___

### Considerations

- These techniques increase situational awareness but do **not guarantee perfect detection**

- Overly aggressive rejection policies can affect usability — proper tuning is essential

- Monitoring systems must also be secured to avoid introducing new attack surfaces

----------

### Conclusion

This module extends the framework into the **post-deployment phase**, adding a layer of resilience through continuous monitoring. It transforms a secure system into one that is also **self-aware**, capable of detecting and responding to evolving threats in production environments.
